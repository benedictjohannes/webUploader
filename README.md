# Still Unusable: Under Development

My purpose is creating a PHP uploader that enables quick local file upload, remote file upload (HTTP + cURL), download and file management with minimal permission footprint. The project is designed to be deployed on shared web hosting where quick file sharing is needed.

## Planned Feature List ##

  - Local file upload
  - Remote file upload using cURL
  - Upload progress bar
  - File size limitation
  - File management 
  - Directory listing 
  - User login management:
    - User authorization
    - Access rights for file upload and management
    - Home directories for users
    - User rights for directories
    - Storage quotas
